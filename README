cassclass.js is an attempt to duplicate the functionality of Scala's case classes in Javascript. This is a work in progress and so far only the class construction works:

Create a case class based upon a name and property list like so:
	CaseClass.create("Person", ["name", "age"]);

The class can be used like so:
	new CaseClass.Stuff("Barack Obama", 47);
